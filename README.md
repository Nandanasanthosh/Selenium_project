## Selenium Project

Welcome to the Selenium project. Here is a guideline to help you get started to Selenium withJava code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `lib` view allows you to manage selenium dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
